# MipsConversionCalculator
This is a binary to hexadecimal to decimal conversion calculator written in the MIPS assembly language, complete with comments and a code report. 

The assigned tasks were to write a program in the MIPS assembly language which reads a inputed file and produces a number conversion output based on the request lines in the input file. By using the afformentioned techniques mentioned earlier in this report, I was able to produce the desired output to both the command line, as well as a new file titled “testout.txt”. It doesn’t matter whether you enter in a file with the results already calculated or one without, it will still produce the desirable results if the request lines follow the correct formating.  
This program is executable via console by entering the command line: “Java -jar mars.jar pgm3.asm” into the console. Afterwards, enter in the desired input file name. Once the results are calculated, the output is displayed and then saved in a new file called “testout.txt”. If you’d like you can then repeat this process by restarting the program and then entering in “testout.txt”, and the program will produce the exact same “testout.txt” file. This can be done an infinite amount of times. Figure 1 shows how the program was built and executed. The sample text “inputPgm3.txt” was used for the example.
